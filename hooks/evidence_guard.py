"""Stop hook: evidence gate for the dev-workflow plugin.

Enforces "evidence-gated completion": when the orchestrator ends its turn with
the current phase marked reviewed but its Evidence ledger in phase-log.md still
empty, block and ask it to fill cited proof before yielding to the user for
approval — and KEEP blocking while the ledger stays empty.

Why not `stop_hook_active`: Claude Code sets that flag on any Stop that happens
*because* a stop hook blocked the previous one. Exiting on it meant the gate could
be defeated by simply stopping twice — block, change nothing, stop again, and the
phase sailed through with an empty ledger. That made the gate advisory. Instead we
count consecutive refusals for the current phase in our own state file, so
"unchanged" is met with another refusal.

The counter exists to bound the loop, not to be an escape hatch: a Stop hook that
can refuse forever can trap a turn with no way out, which is worse than the hole it
closes. So after MAX_BLOCKS refusals the gate yields — but says loudly that it is
giving up on an unproven phase, so this can never happen SILENTLY.

Safety: fail-open on any error; stays silent unless a dev-workflow phase-log is
active and a phase is in the specific reviewed-but-unproven state. Only gates the
main turn (Stop), never subagents.
