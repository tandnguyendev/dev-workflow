"""SessionStart hook for the dev-workflow plugin.

Re-surfaces the workflow's file-based source of truth into context at the start
of every session (including resume and post-compact), so the current phase and
approval state are not lost to context rot. Prints a short status block to
stdout (which SessionStart injects into context). Stays SILENT when no workflow
is active (no phase-log.md), so it never adds noise to unrelated sessions.
