"""Stop hook: plan-and-budget guard for the dev-workflow plugin.

The workflow's two cheapness levers are both NUMBERS the model chooses for itself:
how many phases a plan has (each one costs the user an implement-review-approve
round-trip) and how many fix rounds a phase is allowed to burn arguing with its
reviewer. Prompt text alone kept losing to the model's instinct to split work and
to keep reviewing, which is how a twenty-line change grew a three-phase plan.

No hook can judge whether four phases were warranted — that is a design opinion.
What a hook CAN do is make the justification EXIST, and make an exceeded budget
visible instead of silent. So this gate refuses to let a turn end when:

  1. `plan.md` has been drafted but its `## Size estimate` is still the template
     placeholder — the size is what makes an over-built plan visible at the
     approval checkpoint, so a plan without it hides exactly what it must show.
  2. A plan has more than one phase and some phase after the first carries no
     `- Why separate:` reason. Splitting stays allowed; splitting SILENTLY does not.
  3. A phase-log section records more than 2 review rounds with an empty
     `- Unresolved:` — the budget was blown and nothing was escalated to the user,
     which is the failure mode the budget exists to prevent.
  4. A FINISHED feature (every section approved) never said what it did to
     `project-map.md`. Stage 5 is what maintains the map, and single-phase features
     skip Stage 5 — which, now that phases have to earn themselves, is most of them.

Like the evidence gate, this raises the floor; it cannot judge whether what was
written is TRUE. "Because it is separate" satisfies (2) — it is the user reading
the plan at the checkpoint who judges the reason. What it removes is the silent
case, which nobody can review.

Safety: fails open on any error, silent unless a drafted plan.md is present, and
bounded — after MAX_BLOCKS refusals it yields, LOUDLY, so it can never trap a turn.
